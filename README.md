TODO:
1. Setup script for new game
2. Add actual Telegram StarsBot

Default folder structure:
/backup
/cradle
/exchange
/map
  /map/output
  /map/pla
/otvdm (for windows-based servers)

Project have been made for cooperative Players vs AI play in mind (You could find it out by merging m files and maps), 
but could be upgraded for PvP gamestyle.
